## Tools

### CatmullRomSpline2D

A simple spline system and editor for creating curve paths.

### FitCamera

Automatically adjust the camera to fit the current aspect ratio. Supports three modes:
* Safe Fit - Add pillarboxes/letterboxes to the edges of the screen to make sure that all of your content is visible
* Fit Height - Scale to make sure that the height of your content is maintained. Content on the sides of the screen may fall outside the viewport.
* Fit Width - Scale to make sure that the width of your content is maintained. Content on the top and bottom of the screen may fall outside the viewport.

### SpriteAlignment
Align a group of sprites. Currently supports two options:
* Horizontal Spread - Spreads a selected group of sprites so that they are evenly spread between the minimum and maximum sprites in the selection.
* Circular Spread - Spreads a selected group of sprites so that they are evenly spread around a central object.
