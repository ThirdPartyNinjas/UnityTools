# ThirdPartyNinjas - Unity Tools

A collection of tools we use to make games in Unity3D.

## Tools

* [CatmullRomSpline2D](../CatmullRomSpline2D/README.md) - A simple spline system and editor for creating curve paths.
* [FitCamera2D](../FitCamera2D/README.md) - A self resizing orthographic camera to help with rendering at different aspect ratio.
* [GameObjectAlignment](../GameObjectAlignment/README.md) - Editor tool for moving game objects around.

## Usage

Clone the repository into the Assets folder of your Unity project. If you only want a specific tool, you can just copy a specific folder to your Assets folder instead. (I recommend creating a ThirdPartyNinjas folder to put them in, but you can stick them directly in Assets or any subfolder of it.)
